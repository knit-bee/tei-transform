# tei-transform
Fix errors in xml document that make it invalid according to TEI P5


## Installation
Install from github repository:

```sh
$ pip install git+ssh://github.com/knit-bee/tei-transform.git
```

### Requirements
* Python >= 3.8
* lxml >= 4.0

To run tests, you also need:

* pytest >= 7.0

## Usage
tei-transform allows command-line usage:
```sh
 $ tei-transform --help
 ```
```
usage: tei-transform [-h] [--transformation TRANSFORMATION [TRANSFORMATION ...]] [--revision-config REVISION_CONFIG] [--output OUTPUT]
                     [--no-validation | --copy-valid | --ignore-valid]
                     file_or_dir

Parse xml-files that has some errors (that make it invalid according to TEI P5) and apply transformations the file content. There are options to
validate files before processing to e.g. ignore valid files. Files are validated against the Relax NG scheme of the current version of the TEI
guidelines (tei_all.rng).

positional arguments:
  file_or_dir           File or directory to process

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --transformation TRANSFORMATION [TRANSFORMATION ...], -t TRANSFORMATION [TRANSFORMATION ...]
                        Observer plugins that should be used to transform the file content. If no plugin is passed, the default setting will be
                        used ('schemalocation, id-attribute, teiheader, notesstmt, filename-element')
  --revision-config REVISION_CONFIG, -c REVISION_CONFIG
                        Name of config file where information for change entry for revisionDesc element in the teiHeader is stored. If no file
                        is passed, no new change entry will be added to revisionDesc. The file should contain a section [revision] with the
                        entries 'person = Firstname Lastname', 'reason = reason why the file was changed' and an optional 'date = YYYY-MM-DD'.
                        If the person entry should contain multiple names, separate them by comma. If no date parameter is passed, the current
                        date will be inserted.
  --output OUTPUT, -o OUTPUT
                        Name of output directory to store transformed file in. If the directory doesn't exist, it will be created. Default is
                        'output'.
  --no-validation       Do not validate files before processing. This is the default setting. Valid files will be written to output directory
                        with new timestamp but without changes to the xml tree. An xml-declaration is added as default and the formatting of the
                        document may change.
  --copy-valid          Validate files before processing and copy valid files from input directory to output directory, trying to preserve
                        metadata (i.e. timestamps are preserved, permissions if possible).
  --ignore-valid        Validate files before processing and ignore valid file during processing. Only transformed files are written to the
                        output directory.
```

The **file** argument takes the path to the file you want to change.

If you want to add an entry in the <revisionDesc/> section of the transformed
document, you can use the keyword argument **revision-config** and pass the name of
the config file. This file should contain the following section:

```
[revision]
person = Name of the responsible person
reason = Reason why the file changed
date = YYYY-MM-DD
```
(The date entry is optional.)


For all available transformation plugins, see [Available Plugins](Available_plugins.md) .

### Example

```sh
$ tei-transform file.xml  --transformation schemalocation, id-attribute
```
This will apply the transformations defined for the **schemalocation** and **id-attribute**
plugins.

## Add Plugins
To customize the transformations, you can add your own plugin that specifies a
transformation. To do so, you should add an observer that implements the interface
of the AbstractNodeObserver, i.e. it should define how to recognise the nodes it
 is going to act on and the change it will apply to these nodes.

Then, you need to register the plugin in the **pyproject.toml** as an entry point under
the **node_observer** section, e.g.

```
[project.entry-points."node_observer"]
id-attribute = tei_transform.id_attribute_observer:IdAttributeObserver
```

After that, install the plugin, e.g. with
```sh
$ pip install plugin
```
